# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Detection using Integrated ECG, PCG, and PPG Signals

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is our final year capstone project focused on early and accurate heart disease detection using a **multi-modal approach**. We integrated three physiological signals â€” **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**, **PCG (Phonocardiogram)**, and **PPG (Photoplethysmogram)** â€” by training separate machine learning models for each signal and then combining their outputs to assess heart disease risk.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

During our literature review, we observed that most research papers focused on **individual signal types** and mainly aimed at selecting the best-performing model for that signal. This often leads to limited diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we designed a system that leverages the **complementary strengths of all three signals**, offering a more reliable and holistic analysis.
